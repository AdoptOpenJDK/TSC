# Platform Costs

Adding new Build variants uses up machine time in our [build farm](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/). There are two ways in which you can help!

## BYOD - Bring Your Own Device

We are able to accept hardware donations. Generally we try to share resources as best as possible so each machine may be used to build other variants as well.

## Use Existing Hardware

Obviously different projects have different requirements and some have more funding than others so these prices are far from a *fixed obligation*.
