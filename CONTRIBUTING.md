# How to Contribute to the Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

If you'd like to get involved in the TSC or contact them then the best way is to:

 1. Sign up to the [AdoptOpenJDK Slack](https://adoptopenjdk.net/slack.html)
 1. Drop a message in the _general_ channel

## How to Contribute to the TSC Knowledge Base

The TSC Knowledge Base is designed to be a gateway (or index if you will) into the various repositories that make up the AdoptOpenJDK build farm.  Each repository is responsible for maintaining its _own_ issues, pull requests and documentation, the TSC repo simply provides a starting point.

For the TSC, we use the repository [Project](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/TSC/projects/1) to manage Issues and Pull Requests.  Although straight out Pull Requests are welcome, we prefer that you:

 1. [Review existing issues](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/TSC/issues) to avoid duplication
 1. [Create a new Issue](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/TSC/issues/new)
 1. Drop a message in the _general_ channel to discuss the issue
 1. Make the documentation change and then submit a Pull Request

The pull request will then be reviewed and merged as appropriate

## How to Contribute to AdoptOpenJDK

If you'd like to get involved in AdoptOpenJDK then we recommend you read the [Knowledge Base](README.md) and then:

 1. Sign up to the [AdoptOpenJDK Slack](https://adoptopenjdk.net/slack.html)
 1. Drop a message in the _general_ channel and introduce yourself
 1. Join the GitHub org (see below)

## Joining the GitHub Org and Teams

Please raise an [openjdk-TSC issue](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/TSC/issues) if you'd like to be added to the AdoptOpenJDK GitHub organisation and you'll be directed to the appropriate team(s).
