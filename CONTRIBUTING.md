# How to Contribute to the Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

If you'd like to get involved in the TSC or contact them then the best way is to:

 1. Sign up to the [AdoptOpenJDK Slack](https://adoptopenjdk.net/slack.html)
 1. Drop a message in the _getopenjdk_ channel

# How to Contribute to the TSC Knowledge Base

The TSC Knowledge Base is designed to be a gateway (or index if you will) into the various repositories that make up the 
AdoptOpenJDK build farm.  Each repository is responsible for maintaining its _own_ issues, pull requests and 
documentation, the TSC repo simply provides a starting point.

For the TSC, we use the the repository [Project](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/TSC/projects/1) to manage Issues and Pull 
Requests.  Although straight out Pull Requests are welcome, we prefer that you:

 1. [Review existing issues](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/TSC/issues/new) to avoid duplication
 1. [Create a new Issue](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/TSC/issues/new)
    1. Please add the TSC project and add a label
 1. Drop a message in the _getopenjdk_ channel to discuss the issue
 1. Make the documentation change and then submit a Pull Request
 
The pull request will then reviewed and merged as appropriate

# How to Contribute to AdoptOpenJDK

If you'd like to get involved in AdoptOpenJDK then we recommend you read the [Knowledge Base (TODO)](TBA) and then:

 1. Sign up to the [AdoptOpenJDK Slack](https://adoptopenjdk.net/slack.html)
 1. Drop a message in the _getopenjdk_ channel and introduce yourself
 1. Then pick whichever repos / issues that you're interested in working in, each repo contains issues, pull requests 
 and full set of documentation on how to work with that sub project.

Thanks!<br>
The AdoptOpenJDK Community.
