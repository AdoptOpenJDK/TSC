## Propsed List of TSC Responsibilities
The TSC exercises autonomy in setting up and maintaining procedures, policies, and management and administrative structures as it deems appropriate for the maintenance and operation of these projects and resources.

Included in the responsibilities of the TSC are:

* Managing code and documentation creation and changes for the listed projects and resources
* Meeting monthly to discuss progress and other TSC issues
* Setting and maintaining standards covering contributions of code, documentation and other materials
* Managing code and binary releases: types, schedules, frequency, delivery mechanisms
* Creating new repositories and projects under the _AdoptOpenJDK_ GitHub organisation as required
* Setting overall technical direction for the AdoptOpenJDK organisation, including high-level goals and low-level specifics regarding features and functionality
* Has a relationship with the AdoptOpenJDK security group for dealing with vulnerabilities in an appropriate manner
* Setting and maintaining appropriate standards for community discourse via the various mediums under TSC control

## TSC Members

TSC members can nominate new members at any time. Candidates for membership tend to be people
who have a competancy for community management and a high tolerance and patience for process
minutiae as the TSC delegates most of its responsibilities to other teams.

Every Dependant Project not currently incubating can appoint someone to the TSC who they elect
at their own discretion.

## Proposed Rules for TSC Membership
* No single company can occupy more than 1/3 seats on the TSC
* The appointing of TSC members occurs on an annual basis and is based on a meritocracy. 
* Candidates with the intention of becoming a member of the TSC should briefly outline where they'd like to see the project going - all in a transparent manner that is available to the public.
