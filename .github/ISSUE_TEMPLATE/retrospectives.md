This will be a Slack call after the release, with at least a week of notice in the #Release Slack channel.

A bulleted list of all proposed agenda items in this issue (whether at the top or in a comment) will be created on the day of the call, with a list of actions added at the end.

Invited: @AdoptOpenJDK/tsc

Retrospective Owner Tasks (in order):
- [ ] Post this issue's URL on the \#Release Slack channel around the start of the new release.
- [ ] Copy actions from the previous retrospective into this issue, while ignoring actions that have an issue link (i.e. clearly-completed actions).
- [ ] Wait until all builds have been released, with no clear signs of additional respins.
- [ ] Announce the retrospective Slack call's date + time on \#Release at least one full week in advance, and send out meeting invites.
- [ ] On the day of the call, compile all of the agenda items into a tick-box list inside a single comment.
- [ ] Host the slack call for the retrospective, including:
  - [ ] Iterating over the actions from the previous retrospective issue, annotating *both* issues with any issues that have been raised for them.
  - [ ] Iterate over the agenda tick-list, ensuring everything gets debated.
  - [ ] Create a clear list of actions at the end of the retrospective, including volunteer names.
- [ ] Close the issue for the previous retrospective, ensuring that every action is annotated with its conclusion (issue link, ignored, etc).
- [ ] Create a new retrospective issue for the next release.
- [ ] Set yourself a calendar reminder so that you remember to commence step 1 (in the new issue) just before the next release.

Add proposed agenda items as comments below.
